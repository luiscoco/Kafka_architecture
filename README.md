# Apache Kafka architecture

## 1. Why Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is capable of handling millions of data or messages per second

Apache Kafka has a source system that generates data (like a producer), and you want that data to go to a target system (like a consumer)

Apache Kafka acts as the middle person

It takes the data from the source, kind of like unhooking two LEGO pieces, and then the target system grabs it 

Apache Kafka is lightning-fast. It can deliver data in less than 10 milliseconds, which is really quick

Itâ€™s like sending a text message and having the other person read it almost instantly 

Apache Kafka is super reliable, like a sturdy bridge that never breaks 

Organizations like, Netflix, Uber, Walmart, and many more make use of Apache Kafka
